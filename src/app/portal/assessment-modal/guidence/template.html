<h4>Background:</h4>
<h5>The guidance here articulates a set of minimum standards and requirements that meet and often exceed UK regulatory and legislative obligations.
  The production of the specified documents enable Banks to manage the risk of Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which are serious threats to security and the integrity of  financial systems.
  The overall risk includes the following risk drivers:
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Failure to comply with legal and/or regulatory responsibilities in relation to Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing; (CTF)</li>
  <li>Failure to deter and detect those who would seek to use the Banks to facilitate the movement of criminal funds and funds designed to finance terrorism.</li>
  <li>Where this is relevant, a supplier must comply with any anti-money laundering obligations to which they are subject in their own right, for example, by virtue of their falling within the scope of Regulation 8 of the UK Money Laundering, Counter Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (or equivalent).</li>
  <li>The supplier must not engage in any conduct that results in it, or another party:
    <ul>
      <li>concealing, disguising, converting or transferring criminal property or terrorist funds;</li>
      <li>entering into, or becoming concerned in an arrangement that facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property or terrorist funds;</li>
      <li>acquiring, using or possessing criminal property or terrorist funds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Regulators:</h4>
<h5>Note - AML internal controls include those policies, procedures, and processes designed to mitigate the risks of money laundering and support compliance with AML regulations. A compliant internal controls program will be appropriate for the specific organization, and based on its specific risk.</h5>
<p>Where a supplier is providing a service to a bank where this requirement becomes relevant, the Bank is likely to perform ongoing monitoring, oversight and assurance of the suppliers’ activities to ensure compliance and minimise risk.</p>
</section>

<p>The principal national authorities involved are the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
