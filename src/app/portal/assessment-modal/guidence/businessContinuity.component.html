<h4>Background:</h4>
<h5>A business continuity plan (BCP) is a plan to help ensure that business processes can continue during a time of emergency or disaster. Such emergencies or disasters might include a fire or any other case where business is not able to occur under normal conditions. It is best practice for every organisation to develop a BCP to ensure its business operations can continue, no matter the disruption.
  A critical component of that business plan is to ensure that users remain productive while maintaining the necessary level of security and control over user access to corporate resource
  Banks will want to ensure that suppliers have adequate and effective resilience and recovery strategies or business continuity systems and control in the place to prevent the following (not limited to):
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Failure to effectively identify and classify business processes, their end to end dependencies and to plan, prepare and implement an effective Business Continuity strategy and response framework for significant incidents
  <li>Failure to respond effectively to significant incidents
  <li>Failure to assess the effectiveness of Business Continuity strategy and readiness to respond to significant incidents
  <li>Failure to review and update the response framework for significant incidents
  <li>Failure to maintain an effective and resilient end to end control environment for Critical Business Processes (CBPs).
  <li>Failure to effectively prepare, respond and learn from Building Incidents.
</ul>
<p>The Supplier may be required to establish a Resilience & Continuity policy, provides a framework for setting Resilience & Continuity objectives and defines the standards for their implementation and operation.</p>
<p>The Supplier may be required to appoint a person, to be accountable for implementation of the policy, monitoring the Key Controls & Indicators defined below.</p>
<p>Potential considerations in your policy may be required to focus on the following 4 themes: Operational Resilience, Business Continuity Management, IT Disaster Recovery and Incident Response.</p>
