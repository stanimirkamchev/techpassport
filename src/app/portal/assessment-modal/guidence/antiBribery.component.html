<h4>Background:</h4>
<h5>
  Suppliers are likely to be required to ensure that they, nor anyone engaged by the Supplier to act for or on behalf of a Bank, may be required to not: a. offer, promise, give, request, agree to receive or accept a bribe; or b. do anything to circumvent controls in place to deter, prevent or detect bribery
</h5>

<h5>An Anti Bribery Policy is required to assist in managing the risk of payments, offers, promises of a bribe (making a bribe) or receipt, requests or acceptance of a bribe (being bribed) by an individual or associated party.  Suppliers should develop their procedures with the aim of mitigating the following failings:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>comply with anti-bribery legislation both in the UK and in the other jurisdiction
  <li>maintain consistent, proportionate and effective approach to anti- bribery;
  <li>respond effectively to 'an offer or acceptance of any gift, fee, reward or other advantage to or from any person as an inducement to do something improper, which is dishonest, illegal or a breach of trust’. This includes offers and promises to give as well as requests and agreements to receive bribes.
</ul>

<h5>Reasonable steps outlined by the FCA include:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>senior management that stays up to date with, and fully abreast of, bribery and corruption issues (Top Level Commitment)
  <li>adequate bribery and corruption risk assessment
  <li>policies and procedures (including staff recruitment, vetting and remuneration) that cover bribery and corruption risks
  <li>training and awareness programmes that ensure staff have adequate understanding of the risks associated with bribery and corruption
  <li>adequate and risk-sensitive measures that address the risk that a third party acting on behalf of the firm may engage in corruption
  It is advised that in order to comply, suppliers shall align with legislative requirements and to the core principles contained in the UK Ministry
  of Justice Guidance issued under Section 9 of the UK Bribery Act 2010.
</ol>


<h5>Top Level Commitment</h5>
<p>Corruption is defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain and is a term used to describe a wide range of financial misconduct. Banks are likely to take a Zero-Tolerance approach for this topic.  Any incidents or potential incidents of corruption by the Supplier should be reported in accordance with any related bank specific policies that deal with activities that fall under the definition of corruption.
</p>

<h5>Top Level Commitment</h5>
<p>Effective top level commitment allows an organisation to drive an appropriate and
effective anti-bribery culture. Suppliers may consider appointing a nominated
individual(s) with technical expertise and professional credibility to be responsible for
the management of anti-bribery risk
</p>

<ul>

Further guidance on risk-based due diligence can be obtained from your supplier manager if required. In determining whether a person is acting for or on behalf of the bank, the supplier may be required to consider the nature of the activity being undertaken. As a minimum, an agent, subsidiary or any other person obtaining, retaining or conducting business on behalf of the bank may be required to be subject to due diligence. The supplier may be required to, as part of their due diligence activities, identify all directors and perform appropriate additional checks to ascertain whether or not any of the directors are public officials and/or politically exposed persons (PEPs). Where the nature of the services provided and the involvement of public officials and/or PEPs leads to an increase in bribery risks, further guidance may be required to be sought from your supplier manager.
